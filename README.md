# ðŸ“Š Student Performance Data Analysis

This project explores how different factors affect student academic performance using **Power BI**, and **SQL**.  
It focuses on analyzing scores, demographics, and study habits to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

## Power BI Features

The Power BI report offers an interactive view of student performance, using slicer, visuals, and key metrics.

### Left side Section â€“ KPI Cards

At the left side of the dashboard, I created **Card visuals** aligned vertically to show key performance indicators (KPIs).  
These headline metrics provide a quick snapshot of student performance:

| DAX Measure         | Card Title              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `AvgMathScore`      | Average Math Score       |
| `AvgAttendance`     | AvgAttendance     (%)    |
| `PassRate`          | Overall Pass Rate (%)    |

#### DAX Code Used

```DAX
-- Average Math Score
AvgMathScore = AVERAGE('view_students_performance'[math_score])

-- Attendance Rate (%)
AvgAttendanceRate = AVERAGE('view_students_performance'[attendance_rate])

-- Overall Pass Rate (%)
PassRate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('view_students_performance'), 'view_students_performance'[final_result] = "Pass"),
    COUNTROWS('view_students_performance')
)
