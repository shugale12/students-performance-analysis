# ðŸ“Š Student Performance Data Analysis

This project explores how different factors affect student academic performance using **Power BI**, and **SQL**.  
It focuses on analyzing scores, demographics, and study habits to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

- **SQL** â€“ Data cleaning, Data querying and aggregation for deeper insights  

---

## Dataset Summary

Includes:
- **Demographic Fields**: Gender, Parental Education, Lunch Type  
- **Academic Fields**: Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score  
- **Other Fields**: Study Hours, Test Preparation Course

## Power BI Features

The Power BI report offers an interactive view of student performance, using filters, visuals, and key metrics.

### ðŸ”· Left side Section â€“ KPI Cards

At the left side of the dashboard, I created **Card visuals** aligned vertically to show key performance indicators (KPIs).  
These headline metrics provide a quick snapshot of student performance:

| DAX Measure         | Card Title              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `AvgMathScore`      | Average Math Score       |
| `AvgAttendance`     | AvgAttendance     (%)    |
| `PassRate`          | Overall Pass Rate (%)    |

#### DAX Code Used

```DAX
-- Average Math Score
AvgMathScore = AVERAGE('view_students_performance'[math_score])

-- Attendance Rate (%)
AvgAttendanceRate = AVERAGE('view_students_performance'[attendance_rate])

-- Overall Pass Rate (%)
PassRate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('view_students_performance'), 'view_students_performance'[final_result] = "Pass"),
    COUNTROWS('view_students_performance')
)

## SQL Analysis

Sample queries included:

```sql

-- Data cleaning/validation

 -- Row Count
 SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_rows 
 FROM 
    "view_students_performance";

![Sample Output images](assets/images/Row_count.png)

  -- Column count
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS column_count 
  FROM 
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
  WHERE 
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_students_performance';

![Sample Output images](assets/images/column_count.png)

 -- Duplicate count
   SELECT 
     student_id,
     COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count 
   FROM 
    "view_students_performance" 
   GROUP BY 
     student_id 
   HAVING 
     COUNT(*) > 1;

![Sample Output images](assets/images/Duplicate_count.png)

-- Average score by gender
SELECT gender, ROUND(AVG((math_score + reading_score + writing_score)/3), 2) AS avg_score
FROM view_students_performance
GROUP BY gender;

![Sample Output images](assets/images/Average_Scores_by_Gender.png)

-- Pass rate by parental education
SELECT parent_education,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN average_score >= 70 THEN 1 END) AS pass_count,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN average_score >= 70 THEN 1 END)*100.0/COUNT(*), 2) AS pass_rate
FROM view_students_performance
GROUP BY parent_education;

![Sample Output images](assets/images/Parent_Education_vs_Average_Performance.png)

-- Final Result Count by Grade Level
SELECT grade_level,
       final_result,
       COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM view_students_performance
GROUP BY grade_level, final_result
ORDER BY grade_level, final_result;

![Sample Output images](assets/images/Final_Result_by_Grade Level.png)

-- Top 10 Students by Average Score
SELECT student_id, name,
       ROUND((CAST(math_score AS FLOAT) + CAST(reading_score AS FLOAT) + CAST(writing_score AS FLOAT)) / 3.0, 2) AS average_score
FROM view_students_performance
ORDER BY average_score DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;

![Sample Output images](assets/images/Top_10_Students_by_Average_Score.png)

-- Attendance Impact on Final Result
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN attendance_rate >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN attendance_rate >= 75 THEN 'Good'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS attendance_category,
    final_result,
    COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM view_students_performance
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN attendance_rate >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN attendance_rate >= 75 THEN 'Good'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END,
    final_result;
